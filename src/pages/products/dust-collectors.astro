  {
    question: 'How do you size a dust collector for my application?',
    answer: 'We start with your process details — material type, dust generation rate, capture velocities needed, and duct layout. From there we calculate the required CFM, select the right air-to-cloth ratio for your dust characteristics, and size the collector with proper can velocity and cleaning system capacity. Our engineering spreadsheets handle the filter selection integration automatically.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What\'s the difference between baghouse and cartridge collectors?',
    answer: 'Baghouse collectors use long fabric filter bags and are ideal for high dust loads, coarser particles, and applications where you need maximum capacity. Cartridge collectors use pleated filter media for much higher filtration area in a smaller footprint — great for fine dusts and space-constrained installations. We\'ll recommend the right type based on your particle size, loading, and facility.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do your collectors meet NFPA requirements for combustible dust?',
    answer: 'Yes. We design to NFPA 652 and 654 standards as required by your application. This includes explosion venting calculations, isolation valve placement, and deflagration suppression options. We can also help with your Dust Hazard Analysis (DHA) requirements to identify what level of protection your application needs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you retrofit or upgrade an existing dust collection system?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We evaluate your existing system, identify the bottlenecks — whether it\'s undersized ductwork, insufficient filter area, poor hood design, or worn-out components — and engineer targeted upgrades. Sometimes a full replacement makes more sense, sometimes a few modifications solve the problem. We\'ll give you an honest assessment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of controls come with the system?',
    answer: 'Every collector includes PLC-based controls with differential pressure monitoring, pulse-jet cleaning cycle management, fan VFD control, and a full alarm system. We program across IDEC, Do-More, and Allen-Bradley platforms depending on your facility standards. HMI operator interfaces are available for systems that need them.',
